# Todo Application using React and state management

## Description

I wanted to build this app to (better) understand React State Management. This first version
of the app is fairly simple since a user can only add, delete, and edit a certain task.

I am planning on adding more features in the future. Another thing I will focus on in the next couple of days
is to add Redux for state management. There are a couple of states that are passed around in the app
that eventually resulted in "prop drilling".

I experienced first hand what it means to pass a state through 3 other components, just to have it where
it should be. That's why I want to use the Redux library to prevent this situation in bigger future
projects.

## Functionality and Technology

Since I am currently learning React, I wanted to build a small project to really internalize React's concepts
and best practices. I am not gonna lie - state management did cost me a couple of hours to understand.
In fact, I am still learning about it. Especially the "edit" - functionality took me ages to complete since
I had to understand hooks properly in order to create the desired function.

Functionality I am planning on adding in the feature:

- categories for the different tasks
- animations for better user experience
- chat functionality for collaboration
- attach documents
- recurring tasks

## How to use the app

I created a Netlify Page for the app. For the project itself I used create-react-app. So you basically just have
to clone the repo, install the dependencies and you are good to go.
